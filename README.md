## LetNet/Alex Net
    a.  We have 64 images in each batch of data used for training. Here is a sample batch of the data we will use.

    b  Due to the computer's performance limitations and time constraints, the model was trained 19 times and saved the best parameters, achieving an accuracy of 88%. 
        The graph indicates that the training values closely align with the actual values.
